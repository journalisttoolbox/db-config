It allows you to store and merge your private data with public data before feeding both into charts and maps. Fusion Tables is mainly used for its mapping functionality. Its geolocation feature plots place-specific data, and styling buckets let you compare different fields from your dataset across your map. You can also opt for a heatmap view, although this isn't yet embeddable, or you can create choropleths by merging your data with a public shapefile. All data is stored on your Drive, and you can choose to share or embed your visualisations after publishing them to the web. Fusion Tables takes local CSV, TSV and TXT files as input, as well as Google Sheets. It can be easily integrated with Google’s other APIs, including the Charts API, the Google Apps Script and Maps API. Fusion Table’s biggest competitor is BatchGeo. The BatchGeo tool geocodes points a lot faster and has a more user-friendly interface, but Fusion Tables gives you more design control and provides BatchGeo’s paid-for features for free. Your choice should depend on whether you’re looking to create an embeddable map or a tool for your own insights - as well as if you already have all the information you want to visualise or need to pull it from elsewhere.","categories":["Maps"],"logo_url":"https://www.google.com/images/icons/product/fusion_tables-128.png"},{"DATE_UPDATED":"07/06/2015","FREE_OPTION":"Open source","DEV_EMAIL":"christopher.hutchinson@the-times.co.uk","TAGS":"image editor","APPLESTORE_URL":"","GOOGLEPLAY_URL":"","CURATED_LIST":"Times","JT_WHAT":"","JT_WHY":"","name":"CardKit","uploaded_date":"01/04/2015","version":"1.0.0","developer":"Chris Hutchinson,Times Digital","home_url":"http://times.github.io/cardkit/#/","download_url":"","github_url":"https://github.com/times/cardkit","price":0,"platforms":["Win","Mac","Linux"],"companies":["The Times","The Sunday Times"],"description":"A web-based editing tool for creating shareable social media graphics.

Designed to be flexible enough to support multiple templates while also providing standardization across the newsroom, CardKit lets journalists set text, images, filters and themes within the limits set by developers.

Developers can download Chartbuilder and configure default styles to meet their organisations’ specifications. Since it takes zero coding knowledge to use the interface, this tool that has the potential to give everyone in the newsroom the ability to create simple standardized charts without the help of a graphics team. The version of Chartbuilder hosted by Quartz takes JSON or CSV data and allows users to specify the columns they want to graph, the type of chart to create, axis format and data attribution. If users forget to adjust any of the fields, Chartbuilder lists reminders before the Export option, reinforcing best practices for chart design. There’s almost no lost time in playing with different ways of representing your data because the charts are drawn according to user input. The whole process from upload to download should take under fifteen minutes, even for the more finicky journalists. Completed charts can be exported as images, SVGs or JSON files. Chartbuilder uses Facebook’s React framework for its interface, Flux for managing data and D3.js for charting.

Like the now-defunct Kimono web scraper, Scraper requires no coding, just an understanding of HTML sitemaps. Scraper is unique in that it can capture not just HTML elements, but those rendered with JavaScript. Once you build your sitemap, the tool will parse through links, scroll down webpages and click through pagination in order to scrape the details you specify. Scraper opens with developer tools, in the bottom half of your browser. You can build your sitemap by clicking the elements you want to capture in your window and saving them as unique selectors within your sitemap. Data can be downloaded as a CSV or, if your project is a bit bigger, pulled into CouchDB for storage and manipulation. Webscraper.io hosts detailed documentation, as well as its video tutorial and a sequence of screenshots to give you a sense of what the extension looks like in action. Its GitHub pages also walk through scraping procedures for each type of element (links, photos, text, etc.). People who have reviewed Scraper in the app store say there’s a bit of a learning curve — the interface isn’t super user-friendly or intuitive — but if you watch the video tutorial and build in a bit of time for experimenting before diving into an investigation, it’s not too tricky to get it working for you.

The developers encourage you to flag any unprocessable cases with them. Tabula only works with PDFs that contain embedded text — scanned documents aren’t readable. The Help option provides instructions on how to reconfigure a scan to work with the tool. Tabula is also available as a command-line tool called tabula-java.

Merging an audio player and text editor in the same web page, oTranscribe saves you the trouble of toggling between windows and applications. It also has keyboard shortcuts for slowing down, speeding up and pausing playback. To use, just upload your file and use the keys to control playback as you type. You can also do some basic text editing, like adding bold and italic formatting, but the really neat feature here is the timestamp shortcut. When clicked, the stamps take you back to the specified moment in the audio, saving time otherwise spent hunting down the correct playback point when triple-checking a quote. oTranscribe works with file formats supported by your browser. On Chrome, that's MP3, Ogg, Webm and Wav audio files, as well as MP4, Ogg and Webm video files. If you're working with MP3, stay away from Mozilla Firefox. You can also link to YouTube videos, as long as you're online. All audio files uploaded to oTranscribe remain private. You can export transcripts as plain text (.txt), Markdown (.mkd) or .otr (oTranscribe files, which preserve the interactivity of the time stamps).

While it has some cool features, like allowing search and selection of SoundCloud tracks from the site itself (no copy-and-pasting URLs), it has no design flexibility and comes with a clunky framework for user interaction. Soundframe requires users to click to choose between locations — and click again to play the audio file. Adding text to a pop-up isn’t supported and uploaded images appear pixelated. It also doesn’t generate an embed code for you; you’d have to paste the url into an iframe element to display it on your HTML page. Since the Knight Lab came out with Storymap.js, the advantages of a platform like Soundframe are a bit harder to identify. Storymap offers significantly more flexibility in terms of design, supporting audio files as well as image, video and text. It also animates with keyboard strokes, therefore keeping with one of the golden rules of interactive design: don’t make users click unless something spectacular happens as a result.","categories":["Maps","Audio"],"logo_url":""},{"DATE_UPDATED":"30/06/2015","FREE_OPTION":"Open source","DEV_EMAIL":"thejefflarson@gmail.com","TAGS":"","APPLESTORE_URL":"","GOOGLEPLAY_URL":"","CURATED_LIST":"","JT_WHAT":"","JT_WHY":"","name":"StateFace","uploaded_date":"05/06/2015","version":"1.0.0","developer":"Jeff Larson,ProPublica","home_url":"https://propublica.github.io/stateface/","download_url":"","github_url":"https://github.com/propublica/stateface","price":0,"platforms":["Win","Mac","Linux"],"companies":["ProPublica"],"description":"\"A font you can use in your web apps when you want tiny state shapes as a design element.\"","categories":[],"logo_url":""},{"DATE_UPDATED":"29/05/2015","FREE_OPTION":"Open source","DEV_EMAIL":"jacob.harris@gsa.gov","TAGS":"","APPLESTORE_URL":"","GOOGLEPLAY_URL":"","CURATED_LIST":"","JT_WHAT":"","JT_WHY":"","name":"Statement","uploaded_date":"04/04/2013","version":"2.0.4","developer":"Jacob Harris,Derek Willis,Mick O'Brien,Tyler Pearson,Sam Sweeney,The New York Times","home_url":"","download_url":"","github_url":"https://github.com/TheUpshot/statement","price":0,"platforms":["Win","Mac","Linux"],"companies":["The New York Times"],"description":"\"Statement parses RSS feeds and HTML pages containing press releases and other official statements from members of Congress, and produces hashes with information about those pages.\"","categories":[],"logo_url":""},{"DATE_UPDATED":"23/10/2012","FREE_OPTION":"Open source","DEV_EMAIL":"andymboyle@gmail.com","TAGS":"","APPLESTORE_URL":"","GOOGLEPLAY_URL":"","CURATED_LIST":"","JT_WHAT":"","JT_WHY":"","name":"Story Carder","uploaded_date":"-","version":"-","developer":"Andy Boyle,Ryan Mark,The Chicago Tribune","home_url":"","download_url":"","github_url":"https://github.com/newsapps/story-carder","price":0,"platforms":["Win","Mac","Linux"],"companies":["The Chicago Tribune"],"description":"\"A simple web app that lets you enter in your story cards, a la the Menlo Innovations way, and print them for your storyboard.\"","categories":[],"logo_url":""},{"DATE_UPDATED":"02/04/2015","FREE_OPTION":"Open source","DEV_EMAIL":"mikedewar@gmail.com","TAGS":"","APPLESTORE_URL":"","GOOGLEPLAY_URL":"","CURATED_LIST":"","JT_WHAT":"","JT_WHY":"","name":"streamtools","uploaded_date":"31/10/2013","version":"0.2.8","developer":"Mike Dewar,Nik Hanselmann,Jacqui Maher,The New York Times","home_url":"http://blog.nytlabs.com/streamtools/","download_url":"","github_url":"https://github.com/nytlabs/streamtools","price":0,"platforms":["Win","Mac","Linux"],"companies":["The New York Times"],"description":"\"Streamtools is a graphical toolkit for dealing with streams of data.

Mapbox’s suite of tools includes a design studio, APIs for geocoding and directions, and two Javascript libraries for adding interactivity to your maps. If you’re new to coding, Mapbox Editor provides an easy interface for creating embeddable mapping projects. You can import data to add markers to your map, stylize pop-ups and draw polygons shapes to show areas between points. The platform has more basemap styles than something like Google Fusion tables, so even the off-the-shelf options tend to look customized in comparison. But Mapbox really outshines other tools for the interactivity you get with the JavaScript and WebGL for JavaScript libraries. While the documentation is geared towards developers, an extensive list of code samples provides a workable starting point if you’re familiar with basic JavaScript. After you request an API key, you can adjust the example projects to add lines and choropleth layers, implement search and filtering functionality, and toggle through different layers. The JavaScript library is built on top of Leaflet, so it works with a number of plugins like Omnivore, Minimap and Markercluster. The GL JS library renders maps in WebGL using Mapbox styles and vector tiles. It supports more impressive interactivity like its “fly” functionality, which animates the journey between two points on scroll or click. You can use vector or raster tiles, GeoJSON files, images or video as sources for layers, which are formatted using layout and paint attributes. The JavaScript libraries can be used to add interactivity to custom maps you make in Mapbox Studio, which are incompatible with Mapbox Editor. Both libraries are free up to a certain number of map views, and the design and development teams are very much active in consistently improving the platform.","categories":[],"logo_url":""},{"DATE_UPDATED":"08/07/2015","FREE_OPTION":"Open source","DEV_EMAIL":"knightlab@northwestern.edu","TAGS":"","APPLESTORE_URL":"","GOOGLEPLAY_URL":"","CURATED_LIST":"Times, beginner_list","JT_WHAT":"A tool for building media-rich interactive timelines","JT_WHY":"The most popular timeline creator for journalists, it allows for a plethora of content sources, from maps, tweets to videos.","name":"TimelineJS","uploaded_date":"27/08/2012","version":"2.36.0","developer":"Scott Bradley,Zach Wise,Northwestern University Knight Lab","home_url":"http://timeline.knightlab.com/","download_url":"","github_url":"https://github.com/NUKnightLab/TimelineJS","price":0,"platforms":["Win","Mac","Linux"],"companies":["Northwestern University Knight Lab","Le Monde","Time Magazine"],"description":"\"TimelineJS is an open-source tool that enables you to build visually-rich interactive timelines and is available in 40 languages.\"","categories":[],"logo_url":""},{"DATE_UPDATED":"12/06/2013","FREE_OPTION":"Open source","DEV_EMAIL":"thejefflarson@gmail.com","TAGS":"","APPLESTORE_URL":"","GOOGLEPLAY_URL":"","CURATED_LIST":"","JT_WHAT":"","JT_WHY":"","name":"TimelineSetter","uploaded_date":"11/07/2011","version":"0.3.2","developer":"Jeff Larson,Al Shaw,Ben Welsh,ProPublica","home_url":"https://propublica.github.io/timeline-setter/","download_url":"","github_url":"https://github.com/propublica/timeline-setter","price":0,"platforms":["Win","Mac","Linux"],"companies":["ProPublica"],"description":"\"TimelineSetter is a tool to create HTML timelines from spreadsheets of events.\"","categories":[],"logo_url":""},{"DATE_UPDATED":"20/02/2015","FREE_OPTION":"Open source","DEV_EMAIL":"ryan@mrk.cc","TAGS":"","APPLESTORE_URL":"","GOOGLEPLAY_URL":"","CURATED_LIST":"","JT_WHAT":"","JT_WHY":"","name":"Tools for Wordpress","uploaded_date":"-","version":"-","developer":"Ryan Mark,The Chicago Tribune","home_url":"","download_url":"","github_url":"https://github.com/newsapps/wp-project-tools","price":0,"platforms":["Win","Mac","Linux"],"companies":["The Chicago Tribune"],"description":"\"This is a box of tools for working with WordPress on the command line, automating WordPress, and Fabric scripts for automated deployment.\"","categories":[],"logo_url":""},{"DATE_UPDATED":"30/04/2015","FREE_OPTION":"Open source","DEV_EMAIL":"thejefflarson@gmail.com","TAGS":"","APPLESTORE_URL":"","GOOGLEPLAY_URL":"","CURATED_LIST":"","JT_WHAT":"","JT_WHY":"","name":"Transcribable","uploaded_date":"-","version":"-","developer":"Jeff Larson,Al Shaw,ProPublica","home_url":"https://www.propublica.org/nerds/item/transcribable-free-the-files-to-go","download_url":"","github_url":"https://github.com/propublica/transcribable","price":0,"platforms":["Win","Mac","Linux"],"companies":["ProPublica"],"description":"\"During the 2012 election, ProPublica created an news application called Free the Files that crowdsourced political TV spending by asking users to transcribe certain data points from FCC filings.

BatchGeo generates an embed code for the outputted map, but since it offers zero design control you’re better off sharing it as a research tool than sticking it into your HTML. You can choose which elements of your data you want to compare with a dropdown selector, allowing you to easily toggle between different fields once the information is mapped. You can keep confidential data private with BatchGeo Pro, but if you’re using the free version avoid dumping sensitive information into the generator.

With modules that extend control over annotations on your page, Annotator is one of the more customizable libraries of its kind. However, it’s primarily been used with academic projects, while Genius — a Chrome extension that lets you annotate any page on the web — remains the newsroom favourite for its comparative ease of use. Your choice should depend on your level of coding ability and the amount of control you want to exert over who can annotate what. You can use the default version of Annotator by including a script tag in your HTML file. It’s also available through npm but works better with browserify or webpack than Node. Activating the default version of Annotator doesn’t give you any of the control features that give it a leg up on Genius; to access those, you need to use its modules. Annotator modules allow you to authorize only certain users and store metadata associated with comments. The authz and identity modules allow you to control for what elements on your page can be commented on, and limits those elements to certain user IDs. You can store annotation data on a remote server, as well as add and remove annotations using the storage API. Configuring the Annotator user interface module allows you to add a tags field to your annotations. It also supports annotations in Markdown. If you’re looking to add additional functionality to your site, there’s support for building your own modules, as well as a fairly long list of plugins developed by the Annotator community for things like annotating videos, formatting annotations in the margins of a page, storing geolocation and sharing annotations to social media. Many of the plugins come out of academic institutions, including Harvard and MIT, where Annotator is used. Genius is the main alternative to Annotator and the favorite of the U.S. media: it’s been used by the Washington Post, the LA times and the New York Times to annotate speeches along the 2016 campaign trail.  You can include Genius on your page by adding a script tag in your header; users who are registered with the site can automatically add their own comments to the page as well. Genius comes with documentation written to a lower level of coding knowledge, and it requires no installation or configuration. The documentation for Annotator is fairly easy to parse if you come from a coding background, and there are a few code samples sprinkled throughout, but Genius will definitely be more accessible to beginners and newsrooms not interested in losing a developer for a day or two to configure the former.

Textures comes with a set of predefined patterns: lines, circles and paths. Paths are further broken down into hexagons, crosses, caps, woven, waves, nylon and squares. To access, set a variable in your JavaScript equal to your chosen pattern, call the variable and set your SVG element’s fill equal to its url function. The code for doing this is provided on the website, and should be self-explanatory if you’re used to working with SVGs in libraries like D3.js. Once you specify the basic pattern type you’d like to use, you’re given a number of other options for customizing your texture. You can set colors, borders, weights and sizes, as well as attributes like orientation, shape rendering and thickness of the pattern. The attributes make patterns highly customizable, and allow you to get a lot of mileage out of the library. While Textures is a simple tool for journalists already working with SVGs, its advertised use flies against best visualisation practices. The site uses choropleth maps to demo the tool, and claims that “textures of increasing size can represent an order of relation.” Patterns are more difficult for readers to make sense of than colors or size, so creating a map where textures represent increasing orders of magnitude isn’t going to get the job done nearly as well as smartly selecting colors with a tool like ColorBrewer. Be wary of falling for the novelty element and, in most cases, limit yourself to one pattern for your entire dataset. Otherwise, you’re inviting distraction rather than comprehension.

Google Charts offers on of the largest selections of chart types of any other JavaScript library of similar difficulty level. In addition to your standard pie / line / bar graph, you also can select from calendar charts, sankey diagrams and word trees. The library comes with a range of configuration options, which are listed in the documentation for each type of chart. Most chart types support annotation, animation and customized tooltips, in addition to basic control over color, text styling, axis and legends. Data can be added using either the custom DataTable class or by importing from Google Sheets or Fusion Tables. Google Charts won’t ingest data from a local file, meaning you’ll need to transfer CSV files to a web server and query that url to access it, or else move it over to Sheets. This process is less flexible than in alternatives like Datawrapper or Chart.js, and makes Google Charts more attractive for smaller datasets that can be transferred to the DataTable class or a Google Sheet than for more complex files. The number of charting options makes it a good resource for journalists wanting a unique chart type who might not be able to use a more customizable library like D3.js. Documentation for synchronizing multiple charts in dashboards is also a bonus feature for the more ambitious journo-coders, and something that similar libraries don’t tend to make quite as simple (Plot.ly being the exception). If you’re a JavaScript newbie, Google Charts has some of the best resources for tinkering in an unfamiliar coding language. The documentation is written for a more general audience than similar tools’, and all the charts get individualized walk-throughs with complimentary code samples. You can also experiment with example code in JSFiddle before trying to implement it in your own webpage.

It queries the National Institute on Money in State Politics’ API for funding data and Project VoteSmart for information on the politicians. Journalists should proceed with caution: while the project makes for an interesting visual research tool, accuracy isn’t guaranteed, and the developers say you can only “maybe” trust the results your query generates. You can use it as a question-generator and with the knowledge that you’ll need to do your own legwork to fact check any interesting results. Because it’s limited to historical data, its utility —if any — will be limited to journalists working on historical investigations. The query interface is simple to use, and lets you search by election year, region of interest, office race, contributor industry and minimum contribution value. After you generate your network map, you can click on the politician's node for more information from the VoteSmart API. You can also edit your query to show the entire network of contributions, which provides a greater level of detail after you pick through any potential large-scale scandals. Overall, the tool isn’t a great one to keep in your toolbox unless you have a particular project in mind within the timeframe it covers.","categories":["Data processing","Research"],"logo_url":"http://www.unfluence.net/siteResources/unfluenceLogo.gif"},{"DATE_UPDATED":"18/11/2015","FREE_OPTION":"Open source","DEV_EMAIL":"hello@mapzen.com","TAGS":"map maker, interactive map","APPLESTORE_URL":"","GOOGLEPLAY_URL":"","CURATED_LIST":"","JT_WHAT":"","JT_WHY":"","name":"Tangram","uploaded_date":"-","version":"-","developer":"Mapzen","home_url":"https://mapzen.com/projects/tangram","download_url":"","github_url":"https://github.com/tangrams","price":0,"platforms":["Win","Mac","Linux"],"companies":["The Times"],"description":"\"Tangram is a map renderer designed to grant you ludicrous levels of control over your map design.
